             <p>
                Threats to sea turtles are diverse, and many species have become endangered. Six of the seven extant species, six in the Cheloniidae family and one in the Dermochelyidae family, are on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. The flatback sea turtle is classed as "data deficient," which implies that there is inadequate information to properly assess its conservation status. Although sea turtles typically lay roughly one hundred eggs at a time, only one of the eggs from the nest survives to adulthood on average. While many of the hazards to these hatchlings are natural, many new concerns to sea turtle species are man-made.The different elements and human activities that affect the existence of sea turtle populations globally are referred to as threats to sea turtles. Over the years, these threats have contributed to a considerable drop in sea turtle numbers. Some of the most serious dangers to sea turtles are as below.

                                When resorts, hotels, and other coastal development projects are built, sea turtle nesting beaches and feeding sites are frequently destroyed or altered. In addition to deteriorating nesting grounds, coastal pollution and sedimentation can also make it challenging for turtles to lay their eggs.

                            <p> 
                                Sea turtle breeding can be hampered by human activity on nesting beaches, including beachside illumination, erosion, and the presence of people and vehicles. Disturbances can prevent adult turtles from nesting at all, while bright lights can cause hatchlings to become disoriented and wander away from the water.

                                Poachers who sell sea turtle eggs on the illicit market frequently target the eggs and steal them. The eggs are sometimes eaten as a delicacy or because people think they have therapeutic or aphrodisiac characteristics. Their population levels are greatly impacted by the illegal trafficking of sea turtle eggs.

                                Sea turtles are seriously threatened by marine pollution, which includes chemical contaminants and plastic waste. Plastic bags and other marine garbage can be mistaken for food by turtles, which might result in ingesting them and possibly obstructing their digestive tracts. Their tissues may become contaminated with chemicals over time, harming their general health.
